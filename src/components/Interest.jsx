      <h3>Chess</h3>
      <p>One of the things I am really interested in is chess. I started playing when I was in elementary school during my lunch breaks. Back then I wasn't really very good (I am actually still pretty bad) but for some reason I would keep playing. I played here and there afterwards. I remember the first little trick I learned was the fried-liver attack, since then I actually started winning more games because I actually had a plan. I started playing a bit more seriously after the release of the Netflix show Queens Gambit. The thing I was most interested in was actually learning new openings and strategies that I could use in real games. Since then, I still to this day watch Youtube videos on chess and I actually spend a lot of time playing on <a href="https://www.chess.com/play">Chess.com</a>. If you ever wanna play chess feel free to find me on there under ezduzit13 or on <a href="https://lichess.org/@/ezduzit13">Lichess</a>.</p>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>I also really enjoy reading books on things such as psychology, science, philosophy, and most of all the self help books (unfortunately). Some of my favorite books are The 4 Hour Work Week, Courage to be Disliked, The Power of Now, The Martian, and so onâ€¦ </p>
    <br />
      <h3>Creating</h3>
      <p>And most of all... I really enjoy all sorts of things. Photography, coding, painting/drawing, are some examples of ways that I like to express myself creatively. My idea of creating is that these ideas area actually not mine. Rather they exist in some weird alternate dimension, but for some reason the ideas pop into my mind and I feel an obligation to make these ideas happen. Creating also gives me a way to explore more of myself, who I am, my taste, and just overall it helps me find new things that I really enjoy doing.</p>
