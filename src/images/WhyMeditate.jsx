<h2>&emsp;Story Time</h2>
<h3
className='blog-header'>
  &emsp;California weather was very nice and I took it for granted. 
</h3>
<p>I grew up in Southern California, which meant I got to experience sunny weather, beautiful beaches, and really good Mexican food year-round. However, after living there for so long, I grew accustomed to it and wanted to experience something different that was going to be so much better. Then in 2018, I got my wish when I had to move to Wichita Falls, Texas</p>
<h3

  &emsp;Wichita Falls, TX was windy and cold. It made me miss sunny San Diego.
</h3>
<p>Wichita Falls is what it is, a small town in Texas. Very nice in its own way, but it was cold and windy. Also— at least in the places that I tried— the Mexican Food was not as good. I started to miss California, specifically, I was missing the weather, the beaches, and the food. Nothing about California had changed, rather, it was just my perspective that made it seem so amazing. When I finally got back, I made sure to appreciate all of the amazing things about her. </p>
<h3 className='blog-header'>
&emsp; When I got back. It was the most beautiful place I had ever seen, but it was the same place it had always been. 
</h3>
<p>When I landed in California, I nearly cried. The hills were beautiful, the people were beautiful, and the sunshine was heaven after many months of very cold very windy Wichita Falls. It is interesting how amazing this place where I have always lived really was, but the whole time I was complaining wishing for something else rather than enjoying it. I meditate in order to appreciate the small things about my present moment before they go away. </p>
<h2>&emsp;How Meditation Helps</h2>
<p>While meditating, I try and become fully aware of my breath. I try and notice whether I am exhaling or inhaling. I try and notice the rising and falling of my chest or abdomen. When I am meditating I also like to become fully aware of all of the beautiful things in my life that I am most grateful for, no matter how small. I am grateful for my families health, and well being. I am grateful to have water and food available to me. I am grateful that in this moment, I feel safe and present. </p>

>I Am Not My Thoughts</h2>
<h2>&emsp;Story Time</h2>
<h3 className='blog-header'>
&emsp; I had a thought. That I am not a writer.
</h3>
<p>When I was younger, I used to never try new things. I used to get in my own head and tell myself “I am not a writer, only writers write.” This caused me to never want to write anything. Through reading and meditation, I learned that this is just a thought like any other. Sometimes I think about Sloths and how they could be alive being so slow. Other times I think about eating nothing but oatmeal for breakfast for the rest of my life. These are just thoughts that come and go just  like everything else</p>
<h3 className='blog-header'>
&emsp; I learned to change my thought patterns. 
</h3>
<p>I noticed that I had some thoughts that were just the default pattern that I would keep falling into. One of which was the thought that I was not a writer. I began to challenge these thoughts. If my mind was telling me not to go somewhere because I didn’t belong, I would go there anyways. If my mind was telling me that I HAD to go somewhere because of whatever my mind was telling me, well I would stay home instead. This taught me that my thinking patterns can change, and that I shouldn’t let negative thoughts run my life.</p>
<h3 className='blog-header'>
&emsp; I stopped saying, I am not a writer. Now I say, I can learn to be a writer.  
</h3>
<p>Now, I tell myself positive thoughts. Instead of saying I am not X so I can’t do that. I tell myself that I can learn anything I set my mind to. Instead of complaining about my circumstances, I try and tell myself that things will get better or that things really aren’t that bad. As I tell myself these things, these become my new thinking patterns. With these new thinking patterns, I feel confident in trying new things and I am willing to take many more risks than I would have done before.</p>
<h2>&emsp;How Meditation Helps</h2>
<p>While meditating, the same way I try and become aware of my breathing— I also try and become aware of my thoughts. I try to hold on to thoughts as long as possible and to truly visualize and be fully conscious of them. No matter how hard I try, these thoughts continue to pass.  My thoughts come and go just like everything else and they are not meant to be taken so serious. Sometimes I start to think that I am not enough or that the moment is not enough. I don’t freak out or get worried when I have these thoughts. I just become aware of them until they pass like all thoughts do. </p>
